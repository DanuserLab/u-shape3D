function [S,C] = conncomp_gptbx(G)
  % conncomp_gptbx Drop in replacement for graphconncomp.m from the bioinformatics
  % toobox. G is an n by n adjacency matrix, then this identifies the S
  % connected components C. This is also an order of magnitude faster.
  %
  % [S,C] = conncomp(G)
  %
  % Inputs:
  %   G  n by n adjacency matrix
  % Outputs:
  %   S  scalar number of connected components
  %   C  
%from gptoolbox https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox
%  renamed by HMF Danuserlab2022 due to conflict with extern/geom2d package
%  renamed from centroid_gptoolbox to centroid_gptbx to avoid CI build issue.
